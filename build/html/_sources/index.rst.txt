Welcome to the Python e-textbook!
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Welcome to this interactive e-textbook on Python! This book will guide you through the basics of loops, how to control iterations, and how to solve common problems using loops in Python. Here’s what you’ll be learning:

**Table of Contents**

This e-textbook consists of two main modules designed to introduce you to while loops and their applications in Python:

1. **Introduction to Loops**  
   Learn the basic structure of loops and their types, including count-controlled and event-controlled loops.

2. **More About While Loops**  
   Explore the details of while loops, including how to nest loops, work with conditions, and apply them in more advanced scenarios with practical examples.

How to Use This E-textbook
--------------------------
- **Interactive Exercises:** Each chapter contains code snippets and multiple-choice questions. To submit your answer, simply click the 'Check' button after selecting your response.

- **XP Points:** Earn Experience Points (XP) by solving the problems. Each question has an associated point value, displayed in brackets next to the question. Points are awarded based on how quickly you answer correctly:
    - 5 points for getting the correct answer on the first try,
    - 3 points for the second try,
    - 2 points for the third try,
    - 1 point for the fourth try,
    - and 0 points for any further attempts.

- **Badges:**  Badges are awarded based on your performance. Each module offers two types of badges:
    - The **Module Completion Badge**, earned by answering all questions correctly and marking the module as complete.
    - The **Expert Achiever Badge**, awarded for answering all questions correctly on your first attempt.
